Basic Installation
==================

First, edit the src/config.h and src/Makefile to suit your
preferences.
Then, just 'make all' and 'make install' to install on your
system.
Easy huh? ;-)


Server Installation
===================

You will need to add your service in the /etc/services file
on the machine where you intend to run the ToolLogger.

Add a line that looks something like this:

        mylogservice    11111/udp       # My ToolLogger service

You will need to restart inetd/xinetd after this addition.
