              Sometimes it can be useful to keep track of the usage of your
              tools or programs. Is someone using this nifty tool at all??
              Well, this is usually done using a licensing program or something
              like that. But since these programs are quite expensive, 
              the ToolLogger be a low cost (read: no cost) alternative.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way it works is that you keep a program (the server) running
              on a machine. This server accepts incoming UDP messages from your
              programs around the world and stores these messages in log files.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is really simple, just link your program with the 
              ToolLogger client library. Then call a  function when the program 
              is started and when it is shutting down... 
              When shutting down, a message will be sent to the server containing
              the following info:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Protocol - The version of the protocol.         </li>
              <li> Tool     - The program name </li>
              <li> Revision - The version of the program.</li>
              <li> User     - The username of the one running the program. </li>
              <li> Project  - Arbitrary information.</li>
              <li> RunTime  - The time the program was running.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It is possible to have different protocols, i.e message contents,
              running at the same time. However, currently the server is only
              supporting one protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you decide to use this facility, I strongly suggest that you inform 
              the users of your tools that they are being 'monitored' and explain 
              why you are doing what you are doing.
